What is WorldSkills UK?

We're a charity focused on supporting young people across the UK via competitions-based training.

We give learners the skills they need to achieve world-class standards and go further, faster in their careers.

One of the many ways we champion the next generation of high-flyers is by hosting skills competitions. We design these to foster key skills for the UK economy, including digital skills.

Employers & Organisations

--Why Compete?

No matter how far learners progress through the competition cycle, they will develop key skills that will last a lifetime.
On top of that, they'll become recognised as being some of the top performers in the UK and have the chance to expand their professional network.
